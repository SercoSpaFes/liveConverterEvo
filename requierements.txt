The evolution of the first live converter will introduce the following requirements:



- will be modular/evolutive: a new mission having similar characheteristics can be added by creating a new configuration.
- can use several circulation flows, like:
   - circulate incomming product to one (or more) destination(s)
   - convert and circulate incomming product to one (or more) destination(s)
   - agregate and circulate incomming product to one (or more) destination(s)
   - agregate, convert and circulate incomming product to one (or more) destination(s)
- will have detailled status of the inboxes. What is currently pending, what has been done
- will have status and history stored in a database
- will have reporting capabilities (as what the 'FES converter tool' provide at this time)
- will have notification capabilities (email, realtime, slack, other...)
- can have any type of 'converter' plugged in by use of wrapper class
- will be visible and manageable from the 'FES converter tool' web application
